    b NOTE:
    |&nbsp;The following table shows the API retrieval status of each agency's code.json. A FAILURE status indicates that either the code.json does not exist, or it had severe errors which prevented the API from consuming it. A PARTIAL SUCCESS status indicates that the API was successful in finding and consuming the code.json, but that some errors and/or warnings might exist. Each error in a PARTIAL SUCCESS status indicates that an individual project had to be thrown out of processing because it was either missing required fields or did not adhere to the schema in a critical way. Each warning in a PARTIAL SUCCESS indicates that an individual project will still be consumed by the API, but that it is strongly suggested that a change be made to the project's json object for the future. You may view a detailed list of these errors and/or warnings by clicking on the "view issues" link (in the right-most column). A SUCCESS status indicates that the agency's code.json has been fully consumed without any issues.
